# website

this repo contains the root of my personal website
everything here has been written from scratch in a few days
soon I'll rewrite it again to allow for better interactions and more content

the background is made up from code snippets from a few projects I made
- [shell.js](https://github.com/Jan200101/shell.js)
- [explosivemodule-async](https://github.com/Jan200101/explosivemodule-async)
- [polecat](https://github.com/Jan200101/polecat)
